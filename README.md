## Reflection

This project was build at the HelloWorld 2022 hackathon for freshman at Clemson University. 

My group set out to build a project using firebase and react in an attempt to challenge ourselves while still being possible to finish in the 12 hour timeframe.

This project was challenging for two main reasons. The first is the unfamiliarity we had with what we were working with. We were pushed out of our comfort zone into using technologies completely new to us. The second challenge was the time. Going from no idea to a completed app in 12 hours was a challenge. The combination of these two things pushed us to be uncomfortable but taught us the necessity of planning and communication to use every second of the time we had.

One of the biggest obstacles we encountered was figuring out what project we wanted to build. We had the idea of what tech stack we wanted to use, but not necessarily how to apply it in a way that could impress the judges.

The reason we chose the tech stack we did was because it is fairly simple and beginner friendly but still useful in a way that we would all benefit by gaining some experience using it. We decided to use a web app to build in order for it to be easily acessible to everyone. This was further helped by our descision to use the React framework to help with development and consistency across platforms. This allowed us to make a web app usable on mobile as well as desktop. Combining all of these with the use of firebase allowed us a beginner friendly way to enter the world of data storage and comparrisons that we used to implement the system behind the site.
